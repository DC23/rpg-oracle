# Oracles for Solo RPGs

I have used the [Mythic](https://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic-gme.html) system,
for a long time. I love the creativity and modularity of that system, but I have
always felt just a little unsatisfied with the way that the chaos factor changes
the likelihood of getting a yes. Additionally, I wanted a system that was
simpler to use, with less reliance on modifiers, multiple dice, and tracking
of numeric chaos factors.

[Morning Coffee Solo Variations](https://aleaiactandaest.blogspot.com/p/downloads.html) (MCSV) comes very close to what I wanted. Rather than a chaos factor that needs to
be tracked, and that provides a moving target for interpretation during rolls,
it has an elegant system of chaos dice. When the chaos factor changes, move the
chaos die up or down a step from d4 to d20. The chaotic outcomes for scene setup and Yes/No
questions use fixed numbers for each result. This makes the outcomes easier
to remember over time. However, MCSV just gives the *and ...*, *but ...*, and *random
event* modifiers for Yes/No questions. I always liked the *exceptional* results
in Mythic, so I have modified the qualification table to add *exceptional* as an
option.

So here I have mashed up some ideas from Mythic, MCSV, and the excellent [Plot Unfolding
Machine](https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/plot-unfolding-machine) (PUM), hopefully without infringing on the intellectual property of any of those.

For scene setup, what PUM wonderfully calls *Expectation Checking*, both Mythic
and MCSV stick with the options of *interrupt scenes*, *altered scenes*, and *as
expected*. PUM adds a number of other interesting outcomes which I have drawn on
to add three different scene setup tables. You will need a copy of PUM to use
the PUM v3 table.

I may add additional oracle tables as inspiration and whim strike, but I have
nothing planned right now.
